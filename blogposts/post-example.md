This is an example of a blog post! Not much going on here, just learning some next js stuff. I know react, so that has been helpful. I'm learning the benefits of static generation and server-side rendering.

Here is a list of personal projects I'd like to create:

- A todo list app for me and my husband
- An interactive, organized, and pretty looking budget application
- A website for an online portfolio (and perhaps oneday store) of my handmade clothing items

It's fun having a variety of hobbies and tying in my skills of being a developer into unique ideas! I love web developing. As nerdy as it sounds, when I was a little girl I loved the idea of making websites, especially interactive ones. Little Isabella would be in awe to see what she's learning at school and that she's getting a degree in computer science! She would be thrilled that my job is to make crazy cool web applications that involve family history. I'm quite literally living out her dream! I'm so thankful to be where I am today, and I'm proud of myself for working hard to get here!
