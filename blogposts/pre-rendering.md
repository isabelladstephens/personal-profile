I have a hobby for sewing and clothing design. My sister and I have dreams of opening an online clothing store that could feature
inventory from my very own designs. I think it would be a cool project to design a gallery website to display the clothing that I have
made thus far. My next step would be to build a mock online store, complete with a shopping cart and a checkout option. I find AI
pretty fascinating, and one idea I have for incorporating AI is to suggest other articles of clothing based on what the user has
previously purchased or liked. I could also add a feature where users can ask AI for suggestions on clothing articles to buy based on
specific events or occasions.

Another idea I'm considering is using the Spotify API. I'm a big fan of music and the interesting analytics provided by Spotify based
on listening habits. It could be intriguing to see what unique ideas I could come up with using that data. I'm still in the
brainstorming process!
